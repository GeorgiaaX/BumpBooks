# BumpBooks

## About the Project

The Bump Books Project is a story-sharing web application that invites users to create their own original stories and post them onto the platform for other users to enjoy. The application allows users to create and manage their stories, and users can give bumps to stories that they like. Bumping stories is unique to the application, it is a 'virtual applause' and allows stories to be ranked based on user enjoyment. Stories are displayed in a recent feed, which sorts stories in chronological order based on creation date. Users must sign up and log in to create profiles to be able to participate in the community.

## How it's made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, MaterializeCSS, Passport.js, Handlebars.js.

The application is created using Node.js in conjunction with the express.js framework due to its versatility and responsiveness. The application also uses passport.js as an authentication middleware that allows for user login and signup capabilities, providing a secured and personalized user experience. For convenience, session management is built in so that users can remain logged in for a specific period. MongoDB serves as the application's data storage, which has been coupled with Mongoose to enable the creation of structured and organized data models for users and stories. Materialized CSS is used as the CSS framework, which provides a consistent user interface across the application that is visually appealing. Handlebars.js is the templating language used that allowed for dynamic content rending. 

## Lessons Learned

BumpBooks is my first full-stack web application. This project gave me the opportunity to work with a multitude of frameworks and tools that I haven't used before. The process of creating this application proved to be both challenging and rewarding. Implementing secure user authentication using passport.js has taught me how to create robust and secure login systems, which I will use on many more apps in the future. I enjoyed using the Handlebars templating language, which I have not used in the past, and I was surprised by the seamless integration in my code base. MaterializeCSS also streamlined the development process, allowing me to focus on the application's functionality and encouraging me to explore more CSS frameworks in further application development. This experience taught me how to manage frustrations and challenges when it came to debugging and troubleshooting, and allowed me to grow my skills as a developer.
